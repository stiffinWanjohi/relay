  title: Relay Webhook Delivery API
  description: |
    Relay is a webhook delivery system that guarantees delivery through
    idempotency keys, persistent storage, exponential backoff retries,
    and circuit breakers.

    ## Authentication
    All API requests require an API key passed in the `X-API-Key` header.

    ## Rate Limiting
    API requests are rate limited per API key. Check response headers for limits:
    - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per window
    - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
    - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when the window resets
